"So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content. [SEP] And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions.

"I mean, on the first question Ross as far as our premium services, just even on the application infrastructure side, for example, in compute, there is increasing need for things like IoT services.

"But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers, [SEP] because we know that over time, it may be not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be in fact a Dynamics 365 module.",1
"The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service.

The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. [SEP] There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones.,1

"So, obviously, as more and more advertisers come in and do that, the more and the better ads we'll have.

"So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.

"And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video.

"And so even though we were reporting a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration.

"And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to target -- to think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what we're doing.

"And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is, and so that's the value proposition. [SEP] I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest – if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps.",1

"So that’s promising, but we continue to see Europe growing just a bit slower than the rest of the regions.

"And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful focus where a lot of people do find jobs and business is less jobs through Facebook.

"In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. [SEP] One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter-intuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is.",1
"In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. [SEP] So you can look at countries where both services, WhatsApp and Messenger, are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example.",1
And what you'll see is that basically people use them a little bit differently. [SEP] Facebook Messenger people use to connect with people that they know on Facebook primarily.,1
"And what you'll see is that basically people use them a little bit differently.

One is just the format. [SEP] And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a new format people had to understand.,1
"One is just the format. [SEP] Then, as we moved into more photos with Instagram, more videos, a video ad on Facebook or Instagram is a very different thing if they perform well.",1
"I think we're getting people up the curve well this time. [SEP] And so some of the tools we've rolled out that I talked about where we can take your Facebook pictures and your posts and make it a story, that makes that process faster.",1

I think we're getting people up the curve well this time. [SEP] The amount of ads we would feel comfortable inserting into a consumer experience really depends upon how many different things you go through.,1
"I think we're getting people up the curve well this time. [SEP] So if you spend more time in Stories, they'll be need to be more engaging because there will be fewer ads in there.",1
"I think we're getting people up the curve well this time. [SEP] Now that may be possible because there's high, high, high engagement in Stories.",1

"The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads. [SEP] So one of the things advertisers are trying to do when they're in feed and ultimately when they're in Stories is drive to transactions and real engagement, one-on-one with a consumer is often part of that.",1
"The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads. [SEP] So a click-to-Messenger ad takes advantage of having both of those platforms so that businesses can deepen their relationship with the consumer.",1
"Pricing will take time. [SEP] So as we bring more formats to Stories and bring more advertisers to Stories, we can build up that demand and balance that out with supply.",1
"And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. [SEP] And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains, or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less",1
"Obviously the revenues could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel, but if you don't need to do that, that's not how we think about the business. [SEP] We run the business for the long term, not the 90-day clock.",1
"And so we did exceptionally well I think in any way that you look at it. [SEP] In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market.",1
"And so we view that as a very bullish sign on the future, that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders. [SEP] In terms of the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a 6 and 6 Plus versus that have not upgraded, it's 73%, or meaning that 27% of the installed base of customers prior to the launch of 6 and 6 Plus have now upgraded.

"And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter. [SEP] But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition.",1

"It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. [SEP] And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really big complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach.",1
"I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting. [SEP] So for example, Nestlé Purina PetCare did an ad campaign in Germany with ZenithOptimedia, and they defined five distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group.",1
I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting. [SEP] The cat food category is big and they want brand awareness.,1

"That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time. [SEP] And that's the new experience, which if you come to Facebook and you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to see what videos a recent page that you follow has posted or the Presidential debate is on and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you can go to Video Home and see that.",1
"So we'll look at all those options, but for now I really think that Video Home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out. [SEP] I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time, like Messenger for example, where we started it in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time.",1
"Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill. [SEP] One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music.",1

"So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally.

"So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. [SEP] I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally.",1

"We're focused on all of these metrics and working hard with third parties and with our advertiser to get those metrics right.

"As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons.

"As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons.

"and so we’re extremely excited about that. [SEP] We also continue to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers, particularly in some of the emerging markets.",1
So I think we have pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. [SEP] You also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales capacity as well.,1
"In MPC, I generally expect he will continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year, that's not new.

"But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. [SEP] Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization.",1
So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs.

"And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle, for good reason.

We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon.

"And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us [SEP] We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program.",1

so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. [SEP] We did announce a region in India.,1
so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. [SEP] The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously.,1
"From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. [SEP] We have regions spread throughout the world; we have 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future.",1
"There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really – continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value.

"There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really – continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value.

"In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improving all the different ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those results. [SEP] We think there's – continue to be great opportunities to do that, and how the supply-demand dynamics play out will kind of impact the overall direction of price.",1

We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. [SEP] Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method.,1
"So that is factored – I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019. [SEP] On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase.

"On the Audience Network, we continue to invest in ad tech, and the Audience Network is a key part of our focus there. [SEP] We don't break out revenue by our different platforms.",1
"But the opportunity to take not just video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. [SEP] And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way.",1
"So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. [SEP] So to share an example, Garmin launched the Fenix 3 Sapphire watch, and they did it with videos ads on Facebook that worked without sound.

[SEP] They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with Carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features.",1
So that will also minimize the impact that will have on the top line. [SEP] we recognize the majority of our third-party advertising revenues of the Audience Network on a net rather than gross basis.,1
"I often talk about how when we develop new products we think about it in three phases. [SEP] First, building a consumer use case; then, second, making it so that people can organically interact with businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people interacting with businesses.",1
"So, I'd say, we're around the second phase of that in search now. [SEP] You know, we have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at in search.",1
"And at some point we will probably want to work on that, [SEP] But certainly there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that, over time, could be monetizable or commercial intent.",1
"It is happening for a variety of reasons. [SEP] One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store.",1
It is happening for a variety of reasons. [SEP] We are making it easier all the time.,1
"It is happening for a variety of reasons. [SEP] We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter.",1
It is happening for a variety of reasons. [SEP] And we continue to bring more and more forms of payment in the App Store around the world.,1

I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. [SEP] We've had multiple price cuts this year,1
"I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. [SEP] We are now up to 49 since launch in 2006,",1
"So is innovation. [SEP] As I said, we have over 350 new features and services – also significant features and services that have launched this year.",1

"On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well.

"So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as – it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. [SEP] The – we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location.",1
"So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as – it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. [SEP] But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers.",1
And so we’re certainly very focused on things like video calling and voice calling and ways that people can communicate with voice. [SEP] And having Portal out in the market has been very valuable in terms of seeing how people want to use that and for – so our teams can have a real target to shoot at and iterate on and continue improving week over week.,1
"So the state that we're trying to get to and hold ourselves accountable to is where we have these transparency reports – right now every six months, but we want to get to quarterly on those soon.

"And then in these reports, we also talk about and show what percent of the content we handle proactively and identify proactively.

"So, very pleased with the initial progress. [SEP] We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole.",1
"So, very pleased with the initial progress. [SEP] So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us.",1

"And so to me that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us. [SEP] And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform.",1
"And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers. [SEP] Azure Container service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux.",1
"But the thing that – the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer is also an ISV. [SEP] So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways.",1
"So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. [SEP] So yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season.",1
"So our goal is to make it as easy as possible for marketers to get to the format of Stories and then deliver the ads where they're going to get the best experience and the best ROI. [SEP] We launched our automatic placements and expanded it, which converts feed ads into a format that works for Stories and delivers the ads wherever they'll get the best results.",1

"We'll be more reliant on Stories impression growth in 2019. [SEP] And while we have opportunities to grow impressions on Facebook and Instagram, that's less so in feed, where we already have healthy ad loads in - on both surfaces and more in Stories where we have lower CPMs.",1
"We'll be more reliant on Stories impression growth in 2019. [SEP] So - whereas in 2018, we benefited from strong impressions growth on Instagram in both feed and Stories.",1
"There are a few big reasons why I'm excited about this and think it'll be good for the user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. [SEP] The first reason that I'm excited about this is moving more to end-to-end encryption by default in more of our products.",1
"There are a few big reasons why I'm excited about this and think it'll be good for the user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. [SEP] There are also a number of cases that we see where people tell us that they want to be able to message across the different services.",1
"So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics. [SEP] First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx as well as our OpEx, both at the engineering side as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about this still at a Microsoft cloud level.",1
"But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid. [SEP] Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server.",1
"But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid. [SEP] We obviously support that with all of our servers.",1
But we also think of in fact our servers as the edge of our cloud. [SEP] So Azure's stack is completely unique to Microsoft.,1
"so we're pleased with that. [SEP] And that's broad-based growth across the globe, [SEP] so we're pleased with that. [SEP] And that's broad-based growth across the globe,",0
"In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, [SEP] because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there.",1
"And we're developing it across a wide variety of ad products, [SEP] so VR is becoming a more significant part of the Instagram story, where it was originally more brand-focused.",1
We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space [SEP] because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms.,1
"We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space [SEP] And there's a special property with Instagram, which is that the increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a pretty unusual combination.",1

"Secondly, we're continuing to make big investments in innovation. [SEP] The things that I would point to are things like AI as well as our investments in AR and VR.",1
"Those, we believe, are attractive long-term investments. [SEP] Those are things that will play out – AI in the near-term, but the investments in AR and VR are really about building the next generation of computing, and that's got a longer-term return window.",1
"And we believe that trend will continue because we’re at the very beginning with people really understanding the power of the smartphones and lot of people are walking around with particularly in developed market. [SEP] What we’re seeing is that users are generating a lot of really high quality content, often pretty short form that people are really happy to consume.",1
"And we believe that trend will continue because we’re at the very beginning with people really understanding the power of the smartphones and lot of people are walking around with particularly in developed market. [SEP] In terms of video content, newsfeed is as interesting as the quality of the content in it.",1
"We are working with publishers to try to make the content experience better inside of newsfeed. [SEP] The best example of that is probably news with Instant Articles where we figured out that, it was the slowest upload experience you could have in newsfeed to link off to an outside article.",1
"We are working with publishers to try to make the content experience better inside of newsfeed. [SEP] Similarly, we’ve had conversations with makers of Premium Content, I think they’re excited by the work they already do with us to use Facebook to distribute their content and we’re interested and doing more.",1
"And we’re very pleased with the strong performance that we had with Facebook itself in the quarter. [SEP] But make no mistake, Facebook, core Facebook is really driving the top-line.",1
"You will see volatility in the bookings number for the reasons we've laid out before, the changing expiry base, but also large contracts and commitments done by Azure. [SEP] And to your point, we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw a quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts which added on a flat expiry base to that 15% bookings growth, which was good.",1
"And so that’s a good example to say, every three years tends to be the length of our agreements and so you to tend to see that repeated, and that’s what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base and that is the pattern. [SEP] It did not.",1
The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to – is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. [SEP] It's people finding post that their friends or others had posted in News Feed that they saw but then might want to go check out later.,1
"And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, [SEP] because one half is pushed, right, going to News Feed and not asking for content but just coming across and discovering it.",1
"And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, [SEP] And then the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content and getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service.

"When you go to load a video and it loads quickly, we made it auto-play to load even quicker. [SEP] You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, that could take 30 seconds to load.",1
"So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it. [SEP] So the big initiative that we have here which I'm really excited about is Instant Articles and the big thing that that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time and that way when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously.

"In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. [SEP] And so you're seeing – of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been interplay between the supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side.",1
"So that's going be an overall factor in desktop, our ability to grow and maintain the desktop business, so I think that's an underlying factor. [SEP] When we get to lapping our efforts on desktop, I do think you're going to – you have a secular trend away from desktop.",1
"So that's going be an overall factor in desktop, our ability to grow and maintain the desktop business, so I think that's an underlying factor. [SEP] We're always going be in a back-and-forth with ad blockers on the desktop side.",1
"So, we continue to be happy with our top line growth. [SEP] As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019.

"We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business. [SEP] That’s happening not just because of frontline workers, but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base.",1
"So I'm very excited about it. [SEP] The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know.",1
"And then I would say the additional expense that leads to the acceleration is driven by three factors, not just one factor. [SEP] And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch tab; and then three, additional investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR/VR, AI, and connectivity.",1

And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things.

"So the work that we started talking about at F8 that we are releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about.

So we're currently working on making it so that that is the highest ROI thing.
