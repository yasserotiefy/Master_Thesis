"So in terms of the deceleration, we continue to expect deceleration into 2020, but it would be, we believe, more moderated and the reasons for that, that we expect the deceleration. We do continue to see these ad targeting related headwinds, which have been playing out slowly, but we think are still in front of us.",1

"So in terms of the deceleration, we continue to expect deceleration into 2020, but it would be, we believe, more moderated and the reasons for that, that we expect the deceleration. And that's the three factors that I cited, the regulatory landscape, potential platform changes and then the adoption of our own products like OFA that we're just rolling out now.",1
"So I think we are experiencing deceleration from that perspective. The specific sort of high level of deceleration going into Q4, we're signing the specific optimizations that we're lapping in Q4, which were more significant.",1
"So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.

"But I think the potential is real and big and growing. We see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers, and our experience is that where are those – where we have those organic connections, that's very promising to turn that into monetization as well.",1
But I think the potential is real and big and growing. We have over 18 million businesses now communicating with their customers through Messenger.,1
"But I think the potential is real and big and growing. We have 2 billion messages sent between people and businesses a month, which includes automated messages.",1
"And we're focused on launching new tools that help businesses use Messenger. For this quarter, we launched new quick replies for customers.",1
"It's really early, but nice pick up and nice buzz there. And click to Messenger ads on Facebook are actually very promising as well because advertisers want to see a return for the money they spend.",1
"It's really early, but nice pick up and nice buzz there. And when they have an ad and they can get a direct contact one to one with a customer, that's been something that people are really excited about.

"So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content. And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions.

"Overall, I'd say that these changes are doing what we expected that they would do and helping people to connect more and have more meaningful interactions. As I said in my opening remarks, that has increased or we've observed increases in some types of sharing and interaction between people based on that.",1
"Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see.

"The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter.

"From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads rolled out, those are incredibly valuable.

"So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services. Overall qualitatively, in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about, like IoT.",1
"So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services.

"So all-up, we have multiple pieces. The other areas, course, the entire toolchain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration, to continuous deployment, and that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which in some sense you can think of as like the Office 365 for developers.",1
"So all-up, we have multiple pieces. But that's all part of Azure.",1
"But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers, because we know that over time, it may be not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be in fact a Dynamics 365 module.",1
"The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service. So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.",1

Now the biggest trend that we see in consumer behavior is definitely video. And that demand flows across social content like we're seeing in Stories and Feed to clearly a huge amount of public content.

"There are just a lot of different experience that needs to get built. And a lot of what we're trying to do is enable a number of those things through Facebook, while also building unique world-class services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that they care about.",1
But we're happy with where we are now. We have a number of services that are reaching pretty good scale and I think we'll keep on pushing that.,1
"I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities, and they did this, they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind imagining what Wizard of Oz characters looked like.",1
"I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes.",1
"When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement.",1
"When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece So conversion tracking is increasingly used, and we work with our marketers to use it even more, and we're also really excited about conversion list because that's the first product we've had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads.

"Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business, and that means their products off the shelves, their services into the hands of people, and so in order to do that well, we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement. So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better, it's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers.",1
So there’s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it’s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration. And when we get to Q4 we’re going to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4 and that’s going to contribute to more of a decel in Q4 than we think we’ll see in Q3.

"So, yes, I think scale is helping. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business.",1
"So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now.",1
"I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services.",1

"I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides.",1
"I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.",1
"The business continues to perform very well, driven off the strength of our mobile News Feed apps business, and really consistent with the trend we've seen in the last several quarters, we would expect that year-over-year ads growth rate to decline modestly in Q3 and Q4, and it's really because we're delivering growth against a much larger scale News Feed business in the prior-year period and also, of course, headwinds are an impact as well, as you mentioned.

"So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed, where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses.

"That we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall.

"To the Instagram question, what we see in the short run is that some of the spend on Instagram is incremental to Facebook and some isn't. Some clients are comfortable with Instagram and bringing a new budget to bear",1
"For us in the medium to long run, we believe that we're not competing between Facebook and Instagram. We're competing with other forms of media.",1
"And if you want the most eyeballs and we think the highest ROI, over time we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram. And so, for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make the case that we can improve the ROI and then we believe if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there.",1
"So I do think over time we will get to more different types of content and we'll build products that serve that. But if you're talking about watching inline and feed, that's not the place where you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour-long clip right there.",1
"So I actually think in a lot of ways though the more interesting question is not in the near-term what we're going to do to develop ways to consume long form content, but what traditional media and content producers who have traditionally produced short and long form content are going to do to chunk their stuff up better so that way it can be more easily consumed by this big community online.

"So on the sales and marketing expenses, Mark, I think you're going to see that be lumpy. That's just due to product marketing and that's just not going to necessarily be a steady quarter-to-quarter trend.",1
"so you'd expect to see that line grow in line with the expense guidance that we're giving. But, yes, we are investing more in general in sales and marketing over time,",1
so you'd expect to see that line grow in line with the expense guidance that we're giving. So it's definitely an area that we'll be investing in on an ongoing basis and I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly trend there.,1
"but I would just say that this is primarily driven by News Feed pricing, and then you have right-hand-column pricing as well, so you have impressions on Facebook News Feed, Instagram feed, as well as Facebook right-hand column. Ad Breaks are really a relatively small – a very small factor today.",1

"And there, we're relying on continuing to improve targeting. And so you've got – the risk there is of course the headwinds that we talked about on the ad targeting front and how that will play into U.S. growth as well.",1
"So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred.",1
That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods.,1

"We know that the signals we get from especially our commercial customers is that there's a healthy demand for the value that exists in Windows 10. We're seeing it in terms of deployments on new and existing devices and the security and manageability value prop that comes with a modern device and the experiences that employers want their employees to have and be able to take advantage of, along with some of the end-of-support deadlines that we have talked about, there is still an opportunity for us to remain focused on and execute on through this calendar year.",1
"We feel this really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth.",1

So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter.,1
"We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2.",1
We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We also saw some costs were moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers.,1

"There are good reasons to be very optimistic about the monetization. The opportunity, full-screen, authentic, very engaging, different format than feed, gives us an opportunity to grow.",1
"So, obviously, as more and more advertisers come in and do that, the more and the better ads we'll have. I think getting that ramp will take a while because Stories is a new format, and we definitely see that it takes a while for advertisers to adopt new formats.",1

"So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.

"And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that.

And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that. We look at – there are more than 1 billion people every month who use our Groups product.,1
"And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that. And that I think is a big social issue that is eroding the social fabric of the whole society, not just our country, but around the world.",1
"It's also worth noting that the metrics that really matter at the end are driving sales And so any of the engagement with ad metrics, whether it's remembering an ad going back to – people have been measuring that for a long time too, how long a video ad is viewed, are only proxy metrics.",1

"We want to build a service that can help connect everyone around the world, so we want to offer that service for free and have it be affordable, and that's completely aligned with what we're trying to do. So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system.",1

I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest – if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps.",1

"In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter-intuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is.

"Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.

so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. We did announce a region in India.,1
so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously.,1

"There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really – continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value. From the price-volume perspective, yeah, the price per ad increased modestly 3%.",1
"There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really – continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value. And then, obviously impression growth is driven by the users' time spent in ad load.",1
"And it's going to depend obviously also on regional mixes too, because some regions have obviously lower prices.",1

It’s growing very fast. And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year.,1
"Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have customers. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%.",1
We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method.,1
"So that is factored – I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019. On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase.

"But the opportunity to take not just video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one.

"So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook Pixels to measure the incremental sales, and got to a 9.7 times return on ad sales.",1
"And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So, for example, you can buy now in one interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network.",1
So that will also minimize the impact that will have on the top line. we recognize the majority of our third-party advertising revenues of the Audience Network on a net rather than gross basis.,1
"I often talk about how when we develop new products we think about it in three phases. First, building a consumer use case; then, second, making it so that people can organically interact with businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people interacting with businesses.",1

"It is happening for a variety of reasons. One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store.",1
It is happening for a variety of reasons. That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts.,1
It is happening for a variety of reasons. The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve.,1
It is happening for a variety of reasons. And so there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainment and other apps on the store.,1
I will point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year,1

"On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well.

"So the state that we're trying to get to and hold ourselves accountable to is where we have these transparency reports – right now every six months, but we want to get to quarterly on those soon.

"And then in these reports, we also talk about and show what percent of the content we handle proactively and identify proactively. In areas like terrorism, for Al Qaeda and ISIS related content, now 99% of the content that we take down in the category our systems flag proactively before anyone sees it.",1
"And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills.",1
"So, very pleased with the initial progress. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole.",1
"So, very pleased with the initial progress. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us.",1
"So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices.",1
"So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall.",1

"But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers because we meet them where their realities are today and also the digital transformation needs going forward, so that's one massive advantage we have.",1
"And so to me that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us. And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform.",1

And so to me that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us. These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to be able to customize applications around Azure.,1
"And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers. Azure Container service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux.",1
"But the thing that – the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer is also an ISV. So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways.",1
So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year.

"On the capitalization point, I'd say the things we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the buildings.

"So our goal is to make it as easy as possible for marketers to get to the format of Stories and then deliver the ads where they're going to get the best experience and the best ROI. We launched our automatic placements and expanded it, which converts feed ads into a format that works for Stories and delivers the ads wherever they'll get the best results.",1
"Now right now, one of the interesting things about Stories is there's a benefit to being an early adopter. So the pricing is really attractive.",1
"If you think about our history, people made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and I think one of the successes we've had is we made it easier for advertisers to move into a mobile environment. One of the challenges that marketers have is keeping up where consumers are.",1

"so we're pleased with that. And that's broad-based growth across the globe,",1
"In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there.",1
We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms.,1
We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform.,1
"And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.

The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to – is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. It's people finding post that their friends or others had posted in News Feed that they saw but then might want to go check out later.,1
"And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, And then the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content and getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service.

"So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it.

"But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.

"And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%.",1
The other dynamics that you've mentioned are still there. And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products.,1

"So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is – the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure.",1

"Through messaging specifically, I'm more optimistic because of the private nature of this space, right? It feels – when you're using a messaging service, that everything there is very intimate and private so it feels like a more natural space to be interacting with a business in a private way for doing transactions.",1
And it's – this is one of the things that I think will create a lot of value for people discovering and interacting with businesses.

"When we think about Instagram Shopping, it's very early tests, but it really follows the kinds of things we do in other areas of our products and services, like Messenger. Similarly, to some of the things we've done in Messenger, some of the things we've done in Marketplace, we're watching for what is the organic activity between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to enhance and enable that organic activity.",1
And there is a path. Every customer sometimes just starts with infrastructure as a service and some storage. And there is a path. Every customer sometimes just starts with infrastructure as a service and some storage.,0
And there is a path. And then the lift-shift turns into lift-shift and modernize and that's where these premium services get activated.,1

"And so we’re seeing very – we’re seeing a lot of interest along a lot of consumer products. They can share video, they can take video.",1
"It’s also probably worth mentioning that video is within a bunch of our products. So, we certainly have video in feed and people can put video into stories and different places.",1
"And the best of them actually carry over into the Facebook community, because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way.

"So that shows real growth people understanding they need to do it differently, but we’ve still got a pretty long way to go, and we are seeing good results.

"So, I think that shows that when video is done well, it can have a really big impact on companies large and small on our platform.

"So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.

"It was a record day for Amazon devices. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015.",1
It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales.,1

"And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. With Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL.",1
"And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. Now when you launch mid quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that, but I feel very good about the execution of those and that is a meaningful component of that out-performance.",1
"We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. I expect to work through that in Q2, I mean Q3.",1
"Which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos.",1
"Which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. And so if you think about all of those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength, you see them again in Q3.",1
"Right now for links that are not Instant Articles, it can be one of the slowest parts of the Facebook app. You're browsing through a News Feed, you tap on a link, if you're not on a good connection, the content isn't cached, it can take 10 or 20 seconds in some cases for that content to load.",1
"They hold us accountable for making their experience quick, and we want to do everything we can to do that. And people in our community, they don't know the difference about whether that content is coming from Facebook or a different place.",1
So that's where we're most excited about there. And we're just seeing that people like to engage with that a lot more.,1
"And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity. In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which is the last data point we have on the full market, there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world.",1
"There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely low share in that market overall. I do think that India, India is the third largest smartphone market in the world.",1
And so I do think – I don't buy the view that market's saturated. And the infrastructure has come quite a ways since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth.,1
"And so as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins.",1
"And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces.",1
"However, that said, I think AR can be huge. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform.",0
And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokémons.,1
"I do generally - I mean, I believe very strongly in trying to decentralize and put power in individual's hands. I mean, that's always been the first part of the mission of Facebook, is giving people the power to share, to connect, to come together and build communities, but give people the power has always been the primary and first thing that we have focused on.",1
"I do generally - I mean, I believe very strongly in trying to decentralize and put power in individual's hands. And one of the ways that we're talking about decentralization is through end-to-end encryption in messaging.",1
"And I think people broadly are starting to get that more, which is why things like encryption are so attractive to people and why features around ephemerality or keeping data less permanently are becoming increasingly important. I do think that there is a very broad sense, as you're saying, that - and greater awareness that having data stored for long periods of time with companies cannot only be an asset, and that it can help provide better services but can also be a liability in that there could be breaches or the data could be used in ways that weren't intended.

"So that gives you some color on the sort of the type of impression growth that we're seeing. And then finally, you've got – you have Facebook Feed which we're still seeing impression growth and that's coming around the globe.",1
"And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser – business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that.",1
"That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year.",1
"You have our top verticals correct, and we see a lot of strong growth in those verticals. Our top verticals this time are e-commerce, CPG, retail, and entertainment media.",1

The impact without hedges would be higher. I was talking about the net impact after the hedges.,1
"And again this is sequentially right. Because on a year-over-year basis actually the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the last 12 months.",1
"And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce.",1
"And so when we do one, it is significant and it’s because we really believe in it, and we really believe in this one and what it can do for customers.",1

There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows – TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year.,1
"There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend",1
"And so, that’s one thing that definitely is a market difference for us.

We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses.,1
"So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years.",1
It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this.

So we had continued efficiency. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis.,1
"So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program.

We've already started down this path. We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping.,1

"I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions.",1
"And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products.",1

"And so that leads why I always tend to say, I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that’s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem.",1

We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods.,1
We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem. And so this is one more really valuable convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.,1
"So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we’ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well. But in the long run we’re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we’ve used in the past.",1
"Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we’re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we’re doing.

There are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are to the capture and sharing tools that we offer.,1
There are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and all the creative tools around that.,1
"There are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly.",1
"So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now, it's that fundamentally the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video. If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watched it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared.",1

"So we've been able to build that up, not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here, but because we're building on this strong base. From a phone, that's a difficult scaling problem.",1
"So we've been able to build that up, not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here, but because we're building on this strong base.

"I think what we said was that we're really pleased with the consumer adoption we're seeing. It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed.",1
so there's a great opportunity here. We know that marketers love videos,1
"But there's not really a price differential you're paying for a video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system. Video is just a format that's bid into the auction.",1

"I think the heaviest lifting of the work we do is really helping marketers in different verticals focus on the right metrics, which are the sales metrics, And part of the results you see from us in different verticals are actually explained by the ability of us to help those marketers measure sales at the end of the day.",1

So we're in the experimentation phase I think with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out.,1
"Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace. So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services.",1
"So we are building them natively into windows. When you have files, they are synching with one drive.",1

I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those.

So we are getting very good top-line growth. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year.,1

Not only does it have the possibility of being the next major computing platform, AR and VR together, but I think it has the possibility of being much more social and intuitive and natural than some of the devices that we have today, whether they're computers or phones.",1
"So there's a lot of foundational work that needs to get done there. When you think about AR glasses, the technology and science to build an experience that would be both comfortable to wear and something that people would actually want to wear out in public, that doesn't exist yet.",1
That's partially why I'm excited about doing the VR work You're not wearing VR out in public.,1
"So I think that that's a thing that we take seriously, whether it's connectivity and making sure that people actually all around the world get to enjoy and benefit from the opportunities that the Internet has or the improvements that come from AI, or eventually upgrading the computing platforms that we all get to use. But when you're running an operation and serving people at this scale, I think you have a responsibility to invest in all these things that are downstream that could help shape and improve people's lives, because I don't think that there are that many other folks in the world who will.",1
"So the work that we started talking about at F8 that we are releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about.

"Sure, I'll start Mark and having grown up essentially in our infrastructure business at Microsoft, I would say that compared to even the previous eras where we did well in the client server era, in face of tough competition and in this era again in the face of a different set of competitors, we are doing well and we are doing well much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these tier 1 workloads which we never saw in the past. If you think about it in the client server era we never participated in the core of the digital infrastructure or financial services or in healthcare or in retail or in manufacturing and absolutely when we think about the digital transformational and design wins, deployment, consumption, it's kind of like what we would have done with some ISVs of the past, how we worked perhaps with SAP in the 90s when we were coming out with SQL server and they were coming out with R3 is what we are now doing with many, many, many businesses as they build out their digital businesses.",1
"And the way that would show up Mark is a little bit I think where you were leading with the question you asked which is when we think about the Microsoft commercial cloud at $9.6 billion and growing over 40% how do you see that evolving and really the question is we have quite a bit of per seat or per user type businesses but what Satya just talked about is really about the Azure concept or participating both in an expand scenario total addressable market which I think people have talked about for a long time but what was different about what Satya just said is our ability to frankly to have higher share in the next era than we had in the last era. And so if you look at then our ability to grow in the Azure would be larger or over any period of time then ARPU seat or per user businesses it certainly could be but I don’t want that to really diminish the fact that there is a lot of room for us and our per seat businesses particularly across LinkedIn, the Power platform work we're doing.",1

And so that's the transformation at play. That's a multiyear and a generational transformation.,1
"And so that's the transformation at play. Quarter to quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility.",1
"And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction.

So we'll just have to watch how that plays out over time. And so what's really most important in winning budgets is our relative performance versus other opportunities presented to marketers.,1
I think it was about GDPR and how that's gone relative to expectations. We've seen adoptions around people who are opting out of allowing us to use context from the apps.,1
"I think it's very important that there is federal privacy legislation.
